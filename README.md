# KASM-DOCKER-Tutorial-Linux

Step 1. Do not install Dokcer any other way than specified on their official docs. (Snap, flatpaks, etc those will not work because Cocker needs to at lowest seat level.)

Chech KVM type (Intel vs AMD) and compatibility too.
Add source, keyrings, run post install hello world test. You know the drill.

Downloaded Kasm put in on my desktop extract. Then simply in terminal same directory > `./install.sh` 
Now we can naviguate to `https://localhost:443` Where we will find a security warning (self-signed) go to Advanced > Proceed. 

At the end of the install script you will get credentials, make sure to save them somewhere safe.
